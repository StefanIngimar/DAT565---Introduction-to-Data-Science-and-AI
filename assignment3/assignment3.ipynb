      "\n",
      "The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\n",
      "especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\n",
      "heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\n",
      "the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\n",
      "attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\n",
      "expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\n",

      "been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\n",
      "rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\n",
      "Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\n",
      "scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\n",
      "clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,\n",
      "and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\n",
      "to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.\n",

      "commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\n",
      "for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\n",
      "to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\n",

      "an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.\n",

      "A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's\n",

      "want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\n",

      "cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\n",
      "anti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One\n",

      "disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.\n",

      "We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident\n",

Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks.

A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, \"Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement.\" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.<p>\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't want to mince any words, here. <a href=\"http://www.codeweavers.com/ target=\"_blank\">CodeWeavers</a> has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released <a href=\"http://codeweavers.com/products/office/\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver Office</a> product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the <a href=\"http://wine.codeweavers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wine Project</a>. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and <a href=\"http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver Plugin</a> (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\" driver.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.<p>\n",
      "\n",
      "A note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.<p><p>\n",

This section simply asks the question, \"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.<p>\n",

You can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments.\" You need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have QuicKalendar displayed on your machine. If you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. If you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on.

So it was no wonder why I was addicted to playing the game Tetris for so many years. The only problem with Tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. Diatris is a bundle of three different - and much more challenging - Tetris-like games. \"For the first game, Y-Diatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games.\" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. If you're not a Tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out!\n",

Brian says, \"I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!\" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.\n",

      "This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. \"The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions.\" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any \"idle tasks.\" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. \"All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks.\" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.\n",
